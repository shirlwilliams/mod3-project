The 1967-1968 Supreme Court Justice case of John Terry vs the State of Ohio ruled in favor of reasonable suspicion to stop people and question people as opposed to having probable cause. 

Since then, many areas of the nation collect data for what has become known as Terry stops. These terry stops often include a pat down which is then called a 'stop and frisk'.
